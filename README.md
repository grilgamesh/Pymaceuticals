This project demonstrates my fluency with Matplotlib functions and Pandas dataframe manipulation. 

The brief was to graphically investigate the effects of potential cancer treatments in mice, and draw conclusions. Details are in the Jupyter Notebook file.


## Observations and Insights

1) Capomulin and Ramicane are noticably better than placebo. The means and medians of these two are far lower than the others (around 40, compared to 50-55).

2) Capomulin seems to progressively lower tumour volume over time.

3) Tumour size is positively correlated with mouse weight; the larger the mouse, the larger the tumours they get.
